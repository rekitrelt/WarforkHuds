# bwHUD
A custom HUD for Warfork with a black and white aesthetic.

INSTALLATION TUTORIAL

Put ALL of the folders provided into
Documents\My Games\Warfork 2.1\basewf

After installing bwHUD, I must warn you that the custom weapon icons don't work by themselves.
You will have to go the following directory
Steam\steamapps\common\fvi\fvi-launcher\applications\warfork\Warfork.app\Contents\Resources\basewf\
and extract the data0_21pure.pk3 file (using 7-zip)
after that go into the folder you just extracted and place the provided "gfx" folder inside, if it asks you to replace some files, say yes.
And then, zip the folder and rename the extension to .pk3, instead of .zip

After that, you should be set, and the icons should work!

If you're still having trouble, you can talk to me on the WarFork discord server
